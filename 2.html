      <h3>Day-2 18th March 2022
        We arrived Udaipur at 6:00 am in morning Garima Bua and Fufaji came to pick us, on very first we visited Fateh Sagar Lake and did some walk, then we reached their home at Hitawala Towers, we played Holi in the society and later we had Maggi in breakfast, Till the time Loshika and family joined us, we all had Chole-Bathure in lunch. Then we went to explore due to Holi everything was closed and we went to a shop selling traditional items, we didn’t liked anything so we decided to go to the resort, on the way we drank Sugarcane juice and reached Aura Gold Resort, and had fun in the pool, for dinner we decided to go out and have some food but everything was closed so we at chaat, ice-cream and Almond shake. We came at our resort and slept.
