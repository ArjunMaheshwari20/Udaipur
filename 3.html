      <h3>Early in morning we enjoyed pool, later we had breakfast in the resort asking other people we came to know that the resort food is excellent, Then We went to Sajjangarh Monsoon Palace. 

        Then we went to Under The Sun Aquarium and saw different types of fishes.   
        Then we went to the 2nd most exciting place of trip, Saheliyon-ki-Bari there we hired a guide name Farukh Sheikh, there were some magical fountains working on loud sound, this was made only for royal ladies at that time there were different types of gardens.
        Everyone was feeling hungry so we went to Dominos at Celebration Mall it was very big so we all ate pizza and decided to go for zip lining at Phoolon ki Ghati till the time we reached it was closed so we made a plan to visit Ek Ling Ji, Garima bua and family also joined us then suddenly we decided to go Nathdwara Temple  we all rushed because it might get closed, but it was open we did darshan and left for our resort we had Manchurian and fried rice for dinner.
